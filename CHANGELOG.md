# Changelog

All notable changes to ClaudeKit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Versioning correction (2026-07):** the entry previously published as `1.3.0`
> (2026-04-11) actually shipped *after* `2.0.0` (2026-03-17). It has been renumbered to
> `2.1.0` to restore monotonic order. Two agents listed under it — `dead-code-hunter` and
> `open-source-forker` — never shipped and have been removed.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Agent registration was silently broken for all 28 agents.** Bare `<example>` blocks
  between YAML frontmatter fields made every agent file unparseable, so Claude Code
  registered none of them — both the Task tool and `claude -p --agent <name>` failed with
  "agent not found", disabling the kit's entire dispatch layer (`/plan`, `/review`,
  `/refine`, `/audit`, ...). Examples now live inside the `description:` block scalar
  (routing signal preserved); verified post-fix: `claude -p --agent explore` resolves and
  completes (measured ~13s cold boot). This also resolves the Task-tool-vs-`claude -p`
  contradiction: local agents register fine once frontmatter parses — `INVOCATION.md` now
  documents both mechanisms (Task tool default in-session; scoped `claude -p` for
  scripted/CI paths with the cold-boot cost stated). Structural regression test added.
- **Headless pipeline was broken at the save step (found by end-to-end test).** `claude -p`
  spawns cannot write into `.claude/**` — the platform's sensitive-path gate requires
  interactive approval and no `--allowedTools` grant or settings allow rule bypasses it
  (all three tested). The planner burned turns retrying blocked Writes and ended asking a
  human who isn't there. Now: stdout is the explicit headless delivery contract — the
  planner emits plan + ops.json in its response, `/plan` and `/refine` save via tee and the
  restored `extract-json-from-plan.py` ops script (recreated; it existed only in pre-2.0
  installs), then validate. The implementer likewise no longer stalls when verification
  commands exceed its scoped tool grant — it reports "executed, verification pending" and
  hands off to the verifier. E2E pipeline validated on a fixture: plan(opus $0.68) →
  review(opus $0.18, refutation ran) → implement(sonnet $0.36) → verify(sonnet $0.64,
  scores matched ground truth) ≈ $1.86. `ck doctor` now checks the extract script ships.

### Added
- **Behavioral eval framework (task 010).** `claudekit eval` + `scripts/run-evals.py` +
  `evals/`: each eval spawns a real agent in an isolated fixture workspace and asserts on
  behavior, not prompt text — planner artifacts extractable + validator-APPROVED, reviewer
  verdict-block format + refutation catches a planted phantom-file defect, implementer
  never fabricates verification it couldn't run, verifier numbers match executed ground
  truth. Four evals derived from the 2026-07-08 E2E pipeline run; per-eval cost budgets;
  `--dry-run`/`--list` are free and covered by offline tests. This makes the quality gates
  mechanically checkable instead of prompt-enforced-only.

### Changed
- **Pipeline commands are dual-mechanism.** `/plan`, `/review`, `/refine` name the Task
  tool as the interactive default (local agents register post-frontmatter-fix; no cold
  boot, shared MCP/permissions) and keep scoped `claude -p` as the scripted/CI path — one
  delivery contract for both. The verifier now scopes lint/types/coverage to the changed
  files (full test suite always); `--all` forces the repo-wide audit pass. The
  PostToolUseFailure hook's embedded Python was a guaranteed SyntaxError, logging every
  failed tool as "unknown" — fixed, failures now log the real tool name.
- **Context budget: lazy skill loading (task 009 core).** Agents no longer preload their
  whole skill list: each declares ≤3 mandatory skills (`using-superpowers` + role-core) and
  moves the rest to an explicit on-demand tier with per-skill load triggers ("load when the
  work touches auth/input/secrets", ...). Mandatory preload drops 16,120 → 6,649 lines
  across the 18 skill-loading agents (−59%); coordinator alone 2,397 → ~350 lines. Effort
  is unchanged — the operating rules live in the always-present `_shared` docs; skill
  bodies are depth that loads exactly when the trigger fires.
- **skills-registry.json is now generated, not hand-maintained.** New
  `scripts/gen-registry.py` derives `agentMapping` from the agent files' Skill Loading
  sections (single source of truth) with a `--check` drift gate wired into the test suite
  — the audit had found 10 mapped agents with no skill section and 2 commands mapped as
  agents; the mapping is now 18 honest entries. Budget gate tests: max 3 mandatory skills
  per agent, every on-demand entry must declare its trigger.
- **Frontier-behavior corpus upgrade.** Audited all shared agent docs, 10 core agents, 14
  core commands, and the load-bearing skills against a 10-pattern operating spec (parallel
  batching, persistence, verification, adversarial self-check, evidence integrity, calibrated
  autonomy, read-before-conclude, context economy, root-cause discipline, resumable
  decomposition) so Opus/Sonnet agents operate at frontier level. Highlights:
  - "Batch independent tool calls in ONE message" is now mandated corpus-wide
    (AGENT_TEMPLATE, using-superpowers, TASK_TOOL_SPECIFICATION, coordinator, and the
    verify/debug/explore/audit/santa/plan workflows). The "3+ problems before parallelizing"
    gate is gone (2+ suffices).
  - New mandatory **Refutation Pass** before any PASS/clean/complete claim
    (VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL + verification-before-completion): what breaks it, what wasn't
    run, which claim rests on prose.
  - Evidence integrity: numbers must come from executed output; evidence is exempt from
    silent-mode token caps; templates no longer pre-print fake evidence (refine success
    banner now actually runs the validator + dry-run; loop-start gate lines quote real
    results); token-optimization can never compress verification evidence.
  - Persistence: retries must change approach (never verbatim — including coordinator error
    recovery); executing-plans' mid-plan "Continue?" permission loop removed — an approved
    plan is the permission; checkpoint to files instead.
  - Fixed unexecutable contracts: 8 commands' broken `@agents/` references (the delegated
    agent specs never loaded); reviewer `--dual` no longer tells a spawn-less agent to spawn
    (orchestrated by the command layer); planner frontmatter reconciled with INVOCATION.md
    (Write granted, Agent removed, Bash scoped to the ops validator); INVOCATION.md tool
    table extended from 2 to 10 roles.
  - Model routing: planner sonnet→**opus** (feeds the ≥90 plan gate), verifier
    haiku→**sonnet** (scores a hard ≥80 gate); coordinator stays sonnet (routing is
    table-driven). 24 anchor tests (`tests/test_behavior_spec.py`) pin all of the above.

### Added
- **Legacy-install lifecycle support.** Installs that predate the v2.1 manifest are no
  longer locked out of the lifecycle commands:
  - `claudekit diff` falls back to comparing managed assets (`agents/ commands/ skills/
    hooks/ operations/scripts/ settings.json`) against the kit source when no manifest
    exists, classifying files as `identical` / `differs` / `custom` / `not installed`.
  - With a manifest **and** kit source available, `diff` refines `modified` into
    `locally modified` / `kit-updated` / `both changed`, and lists project-added
    `custom` files.
  - `claudekit update` now works on pre-manifest installs (confirmation-gated full-mode
    reinstall that writes a manifest for next time).
  - The installer preserves project-custom assets across reinstalls: backup files not
    tracked by the old manifest (or, for pre-manifest backups, anything under
    `agents/ commands/ skills/`) are restored into the new tree instead of being
    stranded in `.claude.bak-*`. Old kit-managed files are never resurrected when a
    manifest exists.

### Security
- **Wired the security layer (was dead code).** `CommandValidator`/`PathGuard` are now
  reachable in production via a `PreToolUse` Bash guard (`.claude/hooks/command-guard.sh`)
  and the `claudekit check-command` / `check-path` CLI. Framed honestly as a **denylist
  speed bump, not a sandbox**.
  - `CommandValidator.from_config` now reads the `security` section (was `hooks` — user
    `safeMode`/`allowedCommands` were silently ignored).
  - Inspects every segment of a chained command (`; && || |`) plus `$(...)`/backtick
    substitution payloads, not just `argv[0]`. `bash`/`sh`/`env`/`xargs` removed from the
    allowlist (payload smuggling). Added `find -delete/-exec`, `${IFS}` evasion, and Python
    `os.system`/`subprocess`/`__import__` interpreter-smuggling detection.
  - `PathGuard`: relative symlinks resolved against the link's directory; protected patterns
    (`.env`, `.git/config`, …) matched per path component (`my.envelope.txt` no longer blocked).
  - Guard rollout gated by `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE`: `strict` blocks (fail-closed), `standard`
    warns (default), `minimal` off.

### Changed
- Packaging: fixed the `pyproject.toml` build backend; moved to true `src/claudekit/`
  src-layout; single version source via `importlib.metadata`.
- Prompt layer: planner ops.json schema now references the canonical
  `generate-operations-config` schema; `execute-operations-config` drives all changes through
  `execute-json-ops.py` (no manual Edit/Write).
- Docs: rewrote `docs/HOOKS.md` around `settings.json` + `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE` (the real model);
  corrected the canonical repo slug to `OmarMokhtar-Saad/claudekit` everywhere;
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`/`SECURITY.md` now describe what actually runs.

### Added
- `/adapt` command + `project-adaptation` skill: adapt ClaudeKit to any project and
  language (including stacks without a dedicated template) — detect installation
  state, learn the project, configure `config.json` commands / `CLAUDE.md` /
  `CONSTITUTION.md` / hook profile / `.agentignore`, verify with evidence
  (hook block test, ops round-trip, `ck doctor`), and record adaptation decisions.
- CLI install-lifecycle commands built on the install manifest (`.claudekit-manifest.json`):
  `claudekit diff` (show locally-modified managed files), `claudekit update` (re-install over an
  existing project, warning before overwriting local edits; installer backs up first), and
  `claudekit uninstall` (remove managed files to a recoverable backup). Plus `ck init
  --full/--minimal/--yes` and `ck doctor --strict`.
- `MAX_DELETIONS` guard (max 3 `file_delete` operations per plan) in the ops validator.
- `scripts/gen-docs.py` — generates component counts from the filesystem and, with `--check`,
  fails CI when any doc hard-codes a stale count (the new `docs-drift` gate).
- CI: whole-suite test job, macOS matrix, `install.sh → doctor` integration job, coverage
  gate, `ruff`/`mypy` lint, dangling-hook-path check, and SHA-pinned actions + Dependabot.
- Wheel now bundles the runtime asset tree (`setup.py` → `<prefix>/share/claudekit`), so a
  plain `pip install` is self-contained and `ck init` works with no source checkout.

### Fixed
- Packaging: `find_claudekit_root` resolved to `src/` (not the repo root) after the src-layout
  move, breaking `ck init`; now walks up to `.claude/agents`. `CLAUDEKIT_HOME` is honored.
- `skills-registry.json`: `documenter` referenced a non-existent skill (`i18n-workflow` →
  `i18n-patterns`), which failed the validate-registry gate.
- Installer: template rendering used `sed s|{{X}}|$VAL|` — values with `&`/`|`/`\` (e.g.
  `npm run build && npm test`) corrupted output; replaced with literal Python substitution.
  C# detection now searches subdirs for `*.csproj`/`*.sln`. `set -E` so staging cleanup fires
  on a helper failure. `settings.local.json` is preserved across a reinstall.
- Hooks: `suggest-compact` daily reset was GNU-`date -r`-only (broken on macOS) — now stores the
  date in the counter file, with stale-lock cleanup. `format-typecheck` read edited files from
  the wrong log (Bash commands, not Edit/Write targets) — now uses a dedicated `edited-files.log`.
  `auto-checkpoint` stored a positional `stash@{0}` ref that pruned the wrong stash — now uses the
  stable stash SHA. Wired the dormant `file-guard`/`prompt-injection-scanner` as advisory hooks.
  Fixed the latently-red shellcheck CI job (`.shellcheckrc`).
